# SOCAnalystLab
This is an Azure Cloud Lab I have created in order to help new cybersecurity professionals gain hands on experience with cybersecurity topics.  This will build the lab, set up SIEM/SOAR open sourced applications and break down the cloud environment.
Before using the associated script to build your Azure lab, you need to have Azure CLI installed as well as an Azure account with an Active Subscription.  
Keep in Mind that you will be charged for resources you build using this script.  
Have Fun!
